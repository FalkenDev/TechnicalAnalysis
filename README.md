# Technical Exploration Repository

Welcome to my Technical Exploration Repository! This is a space where I delve into various technologies, tools, and methodologies, documenting my findings and experiences. Here, you'll find detailed analyses and experiments on tools like GitHub for team collaboration, exploring Doppler for environment variable management, testing load balancers, and much more.

At the moment all the analysis is written in swedish.
